Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website showcasing my work, skills, projects and achievements. The goal:

To provide a sleek, modern, cinematic-colored user interface that leaves a strong impression.

To highlight my tech stack, past work/­projects, and contact information in one responsive website.

To serve as a hub for my online presence: blog links, GitHub, LinkedIn, and downloadable CV.

Key Features

Responsive layout that works on mobile, tablet and desktop.

Hero section with cinematic colours and animations/transition effects.

Navigation bar with smooth scroll to sections (About, Skills, Projects, Contact).

Projects gallery: clickable image cards to open project details or live demos.

Skills section: icons or bars to illustrate proficiency.

Contact form or direct links for emailing / social media.

Downloadable resume/CV button.

Clean, minimal design that emphasises readability and aesthetics.

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (possibly SASS/SCSS), JavaScript (or a framework if used).

Animations/Transitions: CSS transitions, keyframes, maybe a JS library for smooth scrolling.

Responsive Design: Media queries, flexible grid layout or flexbox.

Version Control: Git & GitHub (you already have the repo).

Optional: If a static-site generator or React was used, mention it here.

🔧 Installation & Local Setup

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/shanu-13/shankari-portfoli.git

npm run dev  # or equivalent


Make changes as needed: update content, replace images, tweak styling.

Once ready, deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel or your preferred host.

GitHub Pages (settings → Pages → select branch).

Netlify / Vercel: connect repo → build & deploy.

Custom domain (if you have one) pointing to host.

📌 How to Contribute (for future enhancements)

While this is your personal portfolio, if you ever open up for collaboration:
